# Summer Training ðŸŒž

## Description
- I intend on solving some problems and see if this can make me improve
- I also have a theory that by doing more Codeforces problems I'll see some improvement
- Obviously I'm not planning on becoming red all of a sudden, but making the problems have an average count of fifty sounds very nice

## Progress by topic

### Segment Tree Saga

- [X] [Xenia and Bit Operations](https://codeforces.com/contest/339/problem/D)
  > Pretty basic, just take the OR / XOR based on the curent level of the tree.
  
- [X] [Sereja and Brackets](https://codeforces.com/contest/380/problem/C)
  > Had already done a very similar problem, just count the number of pairs of "()" and multiply by two.
  
- [X] [Circular RMQ](https://codeforces.com/contest/52/problem/C)
  > The problem itself is very straightforward, but the input sucks. Nonetheless a cool problem, made me get a better grasp of Lazy Propagation.
  
- [X] [XOR on Segment](https://codeforces.com/contest/242/problem/E)
  > Hardest problem I did today, had to look at the editorial for this one. Turns out it was a Segment Tree for every bit of every number.

### Meet in the Middle Saga
- [X] [Meet in the Middle](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1628)
  > Just a very simple problem to get a grasp of the Meet in the Middle technique.

- [X] [Maximum Subsequence](https://codeforces.com/contest/888/problem/E)
  > Very similar to the first problem, just divide the problem into two halves and merge them using binary search.

- [X] [Xor-Paths](https://codeforces.com/contest/1006/problem/F)
  > Already had done a similar problem on AtCoder, just used Meet in the Middle with a BFS / DFS to find the xor paths inside a matrix.

### Mathematics Saga
- [X] [Ira and Flamenco](https://codeforces.com/contest/1833/problem/F)
  > Just some combinatorics with prefix sum and binary search.

- [X] [Lucky Chains](https://codeforces.com/contest/1766/problem/D)
  > A somewhat hard problem about number theory, had to ask gustavoleal for some tips on how to solve this one.

- [X] [Parking Lot](https://codeforces.com/contest/630/problem/I)
  > Just some basic combinatorics concepts.
