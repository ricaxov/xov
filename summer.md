# Summer Training ðŸŒž

## Description
- I intend on solving some problems of stuff I don't know enough about and see if this can make me improve
- I also have a theory that by doing more Codeforces problems I'll see some improvement
- Obviously I'm not planning on becoming red all of a sudden, but making the problems have an average count of fifty sounds very nice
