# Summer Training ðŸŒž

## Description
- (I'll rewrite everything later, cause it seems kinda bad ðŸ˜¥)
- I intend on solving some problems of stuff I don't know enough about and see if this can make me improve
- I also have a theory that by doing more Codeforces problems I'll see some improvement
- Obviously I'm not planning on becoming red all of a sudden, but making the problems have an average count of fifty sounds very nice

## Progress by topic

### Segment Tree Saga
- Just as a note for later: I want to write a little description about the problems to make sure the solutions are as clear as possible to me, but I'll do this later since the focus of now is doing as most as possible
