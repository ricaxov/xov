# Summer Training ðŸŒž

## Description
- I intend on doing some problems of stuff I don't know enough or don't know at all and see if this can make me improve
- I also have a thoery that by doing more Codeforces problems we'll see some improvement
- Obviously I'm not planning on becoming red all of a sudden, but making the problems have an average count of fiftyish sounds very nice
