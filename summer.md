# Summer Training ðŸŒž

## Description
- I intend on solving some problems and see if this can make me improve
- I also have a theory that by doing more Codeforces problems I'll see some improvement
- Obviously I'm not planning on becoming red all of a sudden, but making the problems have an average count of fifty sounds very nice

## Progress by topic

### Segment Tree Saga

#### 22/12/2023

- [X] [Xenia and Bit Operations](https://codeforces.com/contest/339/problem/D)
  > Pretty basic, just take the OR / XOR based on the curent level of the tree.
- [X] [Sereja and Brackets](https://codeforces.com/contest/380/problem/C)
  > Had already done a very similar problem, just count the number of pairs of "()" and multiply by two.
- [X] [Circular RMQ](https://codeforces.com/contest/52/problem/C)
  > The problem itself is very straightforward, but the input sucks. Nonetheless a cool problem, made me get a better grasp of Lazy Propagation.
- [X] [XOR on Segment](https://codeforces.com/contest/242/problem/E)
  > Hardest problem I did today, had to look at the editorial for this one. Turns out it was a Segment Tree for every bit of every number.
