# Script

## This is just a simple, but kinda usefull, script I made to make it easier to debug my stuff

- To run the code you just need to use this command line

```sh
chmod +x script.sh && ./script.sh
```

- Just remember to change the name of these three files to their respective name 

```sh
solve="a"
expected="b"
cases="c"
```
