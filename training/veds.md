# Virtual Every Day September

Got this idea after i saw [Jotinha](https://codeforces.com/profile/Jotinha) and [Huglio](https://codeforces.com/profile/huglio) doing some virtuals, so i thought that i should do the same.

Since i'm gonna start this on September 11th, it's not gonna be every single day of September, but you get the point.

I'll be using the [Codeforces Visualizer](https://cfviz.netlify.app/virtual-rating-change.html) to calculate my rating changes.

My theory is that after september i can maybe reach cyan or at least get a little better.
