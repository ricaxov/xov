# Virtual Every Day September

Got this idea after I saw [Jotinha](https://codeforces.com/profile/Jotinha) and [Huglio](https://codeforces.com/profile/huglio) doing some virtuals, so I thought that I should do the same.

I'll be using the [Codeforces Visualizer](https://cfviz.netlify.app/virtual-rating-change.html) to calculate my rating changes.
