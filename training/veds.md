# Virtual Every Day September

Got this idea after I saw [Jotinha](https://codeforces.com/profile/Jotinha) and [Huglio](https://codeforces.com/profile/huglio) doing some virtuals, so I thought I'd do the same.

I'll be using the [Codeforces Visualizer](https://cfviz.netlify.app/virtual-rating-change.html) to calculate my rating changes.

## Day 1
[Codeforces Round 486](https://codeforces.com/contest/988)

- ricaxov: $1212 + 68 = 1280$
- iago_123: $1016 + 120 = 1136$
  
### Upsolving xov

- [X] C - Equal Sums
- [X] D - Points and Powers of Two

### Upsolving iago

- [X] C - Equal Sums
- [ ] D - Points and Powers of Two

## Day 2
[Codeforces Round 686](https://codeforces.com/contest/1454)

- ricaxov: $1280 + 100 = 1380$
- iago_123: $1136 + 4 = 1140$
  
### Upsolving xov

- [ ] E - Number of Simple Paths

### Upsolving iago

- [X] D - Number into Sequence
- [ ] E - Number of Simple Paths
